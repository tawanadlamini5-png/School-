        A laptop is a portable, all-in-one personal computer with a built-in screen, keyboard, trackpad, and battery, designed to be easily carried and used in different locations, functioning much like a desktop computer but in a single, foldable unit. Also called a notebook, it combines all core components like the processor, memory, and storage into a compact, portable chassis, allowing users to work, browse, play, or create from anywhere.
